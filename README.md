# The Naming Game

The naming  game is a language game model proposed by Luc Steels. The model defines a simple process in which a number of artificial agents try to name a set of available objects around them. In  particular, they try to establish a shared convention about these object names by following a pair-wise communication pattern.

Two implementations of naming game are assumed â€“ basic naming game and naming game with alignment. In the basic approach, agents adopt every name that they hear for each object and use all of these names. The alignment approach uses a scoring strategy which scores the names that each agent uses based on how many times they are heard. Implementation of the basic approach results in   introduction of numerous synonyms, which complicates the communication. The alignment approach solves this issue by eliminating synonyms.

The major result of this project is the proposed extended model of naming game with trust mechanics. These mechanics are introduced  for both basic naming  game and the naming game with alignment approaches. With the introduced trust mechanics, a  hearer undergoes some additional steps based on its trust to the speaker, before adopting a name that it heard from it.
